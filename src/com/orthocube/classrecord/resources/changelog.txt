CHANGELOG:

3.0.2 (October 25, 2018)
    * Java 8 compatibility added

3.0.1 (June 27, 2017)
    * Now more clearly indicates the current day
      on the schedule table
    + Now has a refresh button on the schedule table
    + Now indicates that there are no dashboard notifications
      if there are none

3.0.0 (June 13, 2018)
    + First official release of Version 3! There has been too many
      change to list them all, since this is a complete rewrite of
      the original, but I'm sure you will find what you're looking
      for easily. Good luck!

2.3.3 (January 2, 2018)
    * Fix cases where Task editor window will fail to show due to
      missing icon files

2.3.2 (September 8, 2017)
    + You can now search the student on Facebook via the
      "Search student on Facebook" context menu
      scattered around the program
    * Corrected the MPS computation to divide by the total score,
      not highest attained score
    - Old DepEd MPS computation removed

2.3.1 (September 1, 2017)
    ! Happy Ber-months!
    + This version adds another "Mean Percentage Score"
      computation as found in 
      http://sciencing.com/convert-mean-score-percentage-5993737.html
      This is becuase I found the Excel spreadseet named
      "SAMPLE Template of MPS.xlsx" (which I based the original
      MPS computation on) suspicious, because it gives percentages
      higher than 100. That is very fishy, so I added another style.

2.3.0 (August 31, 2017)
    ! This was a rather hurried update.
    + Automatic MPS computation
    + Database Engine updated to support individual course
      per enrollee (DB Engine V4)
    + Enrollee Course is used to separate the students
      in a class per course, for MPS and Grade viewing.
    * Several small tweaks.

2.2.0 (August 30, 2017)
    + Partial printing support for
      SHS Grades into official FCAT form
    + Partial exporting of SHS grades into Excel
    + Complete exporting of SHS grades into simple Excel form
    * Other small fixes

2.1.1 (August 3, 2017)
    + Class list display was sped up significantly
      (fast enough that you won't even notice it load.)

2.1.0 (July 26, 2017)
    + Database is now backed-up every log in, retaining up to
      50 old copies of the database. Restoring old
      backups can only be done manually for security
      (simply rename the backup to the correct file name)
    + Faces in photos are now properly rotated AND scaled
      to fit the border
    + "Please wait..." message while logging in since
      it takes some time for the program to load
    + Some UI rearrangements
    + Right-clicking a class shows quick Attendance
      operations menu
    * Splash screen now properly displayed

2.0.0 (July 24, 2017)
    + Version 2 WTF
    + Account passwords are now hashed for added security
    + When adding a student's photo, the image can now be rotated
      to make the eyes horizontal and centered on the image
    + Actions operating on data are now accessible on
      right-clicking table rows
    + UI now full of cute icons
    + Several form layout improvements
    + Account permissions implemented
    + Double click on table rows to edit or view the item
    + Double click on table rows to select a student
      (e.g. when adding scores or enrolling students)
    + Text is now shown antialiased even on Japanese version of
      Windows for improved text readability
    * Fix windows showing multiple times when clicking
      buttons multiple times
    * Fix program crash on "Add Attendance Day" close
    * Fix table cells editable even when DB isn't actually
      being edited  
    * Fix user password being displayed (asterisked) when
      editing user list--password itself isn't visible
      but showing how many characters a password has is still
      a security vulnerability
    * Windows are now shown centered on their parent
      window, not on the center of the screen
    ! Still not implemented on Java FX but I think I will
      continue to use Swing anyway, since the program
      is already this good XD

1.2.0 (July 22, 2017)
    + More options in searching and viewing class list
    + Clicking [Enter] key is equivalent to clicking
